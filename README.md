# Problem Statement
Develop a system to monitor and predict temperature compliance during the transit of pharmaceutical products to ensure they remain within the required range (2°C–8°C), providing early warnings for any deviations.
An estimated loss of $34.1 Billion is incurred annually world-wide due to improper storage ,transportation and handling of pharma products.

# Objective:
1. Ensure product safety by monitoring temperature compliance.
2. Detect anomalies or trends leading to temperature deviations.
3. Provide actionable insights to logistics operators (e.g., when equipment may fail or external conditions pose a risk).

# Key Metrics:
1. Percentage of time within the 2°C–8°C range.
2. Number of temperature excursions detected and resolved.
3. Prediction accuracy for temperature deviations.

# Model Development
 Step 1: We are simulating a data set to procced with building the model.
 Step2: Data Processing
For data processing they are a list of general checks and based on the problem in hand there could be specific steps
Coming to general steps, 1.Handling Missing Values 2.Removing the duplicates 3.Data type conversions (If needed) 4.Outlier Detection & Handling
More specific steps could be for example, 1.Normalise or Scale data 2.Create Derived Features if needed 3.Data Labelling / Categorizing data
