# Problem Statement
Develop a system to monitor and predict temperature compliance during the transit of pharmaceutical products to ensure they remain within the required range (2°C–8°C), providing early warnings for any deviations.

# Objective:
1. Ensure product safety by monitoring temperature compliance.
2. Detect anomalies or trends leading to temperature deviations.
3. Provide actionable insights to logistics operators (e.g., when equipment may fail or external conditions pose a risk).

# Key Metrics:
1. Percentage of time within the 2°C–8°C range.
2. Number of temperature excursions detected and resolved.
3. Prediction accuracy for temperature deviations.
