#Problem statement
Develop a system to monitor and predict temperature compliance during the transit of pharmaceutical products to ensure they remain within the required range (2°C–8°C), providing early warnings for any deviations.

Objective:

Ensure product safety by monitoring temperature compliance.
Detect anomalies or trends leading to temperature deviations.
Provide actionable insights to logistics operators (e.g., when equipment may fail or external conditions pose a risk).
Key Metrics:

Percentage of time within the 2°C–8°C range.
Number of temperature excursions detected and resolved.
Prediction accuracy for temperature deviations.
