Optimizing cold chain logistics for pharmaceuticals in Switzerland
This project aims to optimize cold chain logistics for temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals in Switzerland. 
The focus is on minimizing costs, maintaining temperature compliance, and optimizing delivery routes.

## Key Objectives
- Ensure temperature compliance (2°C–8°C) during transit.
- Optimize routes to reduce costs and delivery times.
- Address cross-border logistics challenges.

## Technologies
- Python, Google OR-Tools, Streamlit
- Data sources: OpenStreetMap, Swiss Federal Statistical Office, Kaggle

## Planned Features
- Route optimization with constraints.
- Real-time temperature monitoring.
- Interactive dashboard for results visualization.
